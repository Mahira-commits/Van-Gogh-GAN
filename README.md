Artwork Generation Using Conditional GANs

In this project, our team has attempted to venture into the possibilities of generating creative art, i.e., content generation, using neural networks. A neural network is an interconnected group of artificial neurons that are organized in the form of hidden layers that use a mathematical or computational model to determine the relationships between the inputs that it is served. We will be feeding the neural network a dataset of different genres of paintings by different artists and run it through a generator and discriminator which will generate paintings of a specific style as per our discretion and then accurately classify the painting based on the whether it was a real image or a fake made by the generator. The neural network has limitations in terms of the type and content of the dataset that is taken as input, i.e, it needs to be served with a well-refined dataset of paintings that are significantly different in genres and styles for the network to accurately generate and classify them. Furthermore, since art is subjective and different art styles may overlap, the classification and generation of computational art is a challenging task. However, the brilliant synergy between art, math, science, and technology has opened a spectrum of possibilities and perhaps we will soon be able to generate art that is original and creatively inspiring.
